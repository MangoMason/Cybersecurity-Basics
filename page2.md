# Creating Strong Passwords
Why Strong Passwords Matter?

A strong password is your first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts. Weak passwords are easy targets for hackers to crack, giving them access to sensitive data such as personal emails, social media, or bank accounts.

## Tips for Creating Strong Passwords:
1. Length is key: Use at least 12 characters. Longer passwords are harder to crack.
2. Mix of characters: Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters like ?@%$.
3. Avoid using personal information: Don't use an easily guessable password like your name, birthdate, or even your favorite pet.
4. Password manager: Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for each account.
