# Enabling Two-Factor Authentication
## what is two-factor authentication?
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security that requires you to verify your identity using two different factors: something you know (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone or an authentication app).
## Why is two-factor authentication important?
Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor (e.g., a code sent to your phone). This significantly reduces the chances of unauthorized access.
## How to Enable two-factor authentication:
1. Google Account: Go to your Google Account > Security > Two-Step Verification > Turn on.
2. Facebook: Setting > Security and Login > Use two-factor authentication.
3. Banking Apps: Enable two-factor authentication in the security settings section of your banking app or website.
## Recommended two-factor authentication apps:
* Google Authenticator
* Microsoft Authenticator
* Authy
