# Recognizing Phishing and Social Engineering 
## What is Phishing?
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals attempt to trick you into divulging sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal identification numbers (PINs).
## Common Signs of Phishing:
1. Suspicious emails or messages: Look for unusual language, misspelled words, or straneg email addresses.
2. Urgent requests: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency.
3. Suspicious links: Always hover your mouse over links to check if they lead to a lgitimate site before clicking.
## Example of a Phishing Email:
Subjest: "Your Cashapp account has been compromised. Click here to reset your password."
Sender: support@cashking23

If in doubt, always directly go to the official website and log in to check your account status, rather than clicking on a link in an email.
