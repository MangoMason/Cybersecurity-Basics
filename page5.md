# Securing Your Data with Encryption
## What is Encryption?
Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format, which can only be decrypted with the correct key or password. Encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts your data, they wonâ€™t be able to read it without the proper decryption key.
## How to Encrypt Your Data:
1. Use HTTPS: Make sure the websites you visit use HTTPS (look for the padlock symbol) to ensure secure communication between your browser and the server.
2. Encrypt files: Use tools like VeraCrypt (open-source encryption software) to encrypt sensitive files on your device.
3. Full Disk Encryption: Consider enabling full disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS) to secure everything on your hard drive.
