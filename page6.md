# Safe Browsing Practices
## How to Stay Safe Online:
1. Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, protecting your data from hackers and surveillance.
2. Update regularly: Ensure your operating system and software are always up to date with the latest security patches.
3. Be cautious of public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts over public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a VPN.
4. Use secure websites: Look for HTTPS in the URL, and avoid entering sensitive data on sites without it.
